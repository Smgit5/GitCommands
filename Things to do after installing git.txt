1. ls ~/.ssh       (if output is only known hosts -> need to generate new key pair)

2. ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"            (replace your_email with you git global user.email)

3. cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub               (copy the output -> open browser -> github -> new ssh key)

4. ssh -T git@github.com              (should show successfully authenticated)

5. Now try to push or pull or whatever
